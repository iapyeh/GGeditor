Unsupported Google Docs Features:
=================================

The Google Docs is a powerful editor, not all features are supported to convert to reST markups. Below is the manifest (included but not limited to)

* Charts

* Comments

* Drawings

* List style

* Math equations

* Multi column

* Page break

* Page header and page footer

* Page numbering

Known Issues:
=============

* When repository was renamed:

   * If the repository or folder name of the binding file in Github was renamed, a re\-binding is required for committing.

* Open hyperlink in a new tab:

   * This is not supported.  `Please see details here <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1634>`_ .

* Only text is allowed in a list item. Text with hyperlink is fine.

   * Image, table in a list item is not supported. If it does, it will be interpreted as outside the list.

* Only text is allowed in a table cell. Text with hyperlink is fine.

   * Image, nested table in a table cell is not supported.

* Image subfolder naming scheme.

   * If there is an image in a Google Docs document which is binding to README.rst, when committing to the Github, that image will be put into a subfolder named ‚ÄúREADME‚Äù. 

   * Which means if there is a file named ‚ÄúREADME‚Äù in the same folder of README.rst, confliction would happen.

* When the binding file has changed

   * If the binding file has changed, according to the new binding name, a new  image subfolder might be created. Which means the original image subfolder should be removed manually.
