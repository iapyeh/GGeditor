GGeditor hopes to help you to focus on writing your idea instead of marking them up.

\ |STYLE0|\  is a Google Docs Add-on for generating \ |LINK1|\  file from the Google Docs. The generated reST file can be committed to the Github repository with the GGeditor. Then, that repository’s documentations hosted by the \ |LINK2|\  got automatically updated.

.. Note:: 

    You don’t need to trigger conversion before committing and downloading, the committing and downloading would do conversion internally at first.

For  reStructuredText Beginners
*******************************

If you are a beginner of the reStructuredText and you feel a little bit of confusing about how to put your documents onto the readthedocs.org website. I wrote a quick guide to help your task to be quickly completed with the GGeditor. I was struggling on the reST for 2 months . Now with the GGeditor and this tutorial, you might get it done in several hours, I hope.
