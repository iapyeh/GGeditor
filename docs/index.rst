GGeditor hopes to help you to focus on writing your idea instead of marking them up.

\ |STYLE0|\  is a Google Docs Add-on for generating \ |LINK1|\  file from the Google Docs. The generated reST file can be committed to the Github repository with the GGeditor. Then, that repository’s documentations hosted by the \ |LINK2|\  (RTD) got automatically updated.

.. Note:: 

    You don’t need to trigger conversion before committing and downloading, the committing and downloading would do conversion internally at first.
