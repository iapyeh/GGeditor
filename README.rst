GGeditor
########

GGeditor is a  |Google Docs Add-on|_.  for editing reST file. That is, you edit the content in Google Docs and with GGeditor to convert it into  `reST format <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_ . 
The converted reST file can be downloaded or committed to Github. Once it was in the Github, it will be integrated with the sphinx service by `Read The Docs    <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ .



|RST|_ is a little annoying to type over and over, especially
when writing about |RST| itself, and spelling out the
bicapitalized word |RST| every time isn't really necessary for
|RST| source readability.
